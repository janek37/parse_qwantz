T-Rex: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were the two British dudes who first tried to climb Mount Everest!

Narrator: THE STORY OF GEORGE MALLORY AND ANDREW IRVINE (INCREDIBLE TRUE PART)

T-Rex: Their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit. They never made it back! A STANDARD MOUNTAINEERING TALE, except that if they had made it to the top, they'd have been the first, AND they were carrying cameras. If we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today, and then we'd know if they actually did make it to the top, since who climbs Mount Everest and doesn't take a picture? NOBODY, that's who.

Utahraptor: Didn't other climbers find the bodies?
T-Rex: Only one!

T-Rex: Mallory's body was found 75 years later, but no cameras were on him. Irvine's body is still up there somewhere, maybe with the cameras!
Utahraptor: Wow. There's something so spooky and sad about their bodies being frozen like that. It's like a treasure hunt with a perfectly preserved corpse at the end.

Narrator: WILD SPECULATION PART:
Text: Could all "mountaineering accidents" be the handiwork of a lone, crazed murderer, loose about the peak? IT COULD BE TRUE!! If so, no-one has survived their encounter with the pushy "Everest Eliminator" and lived to tell the tale.
T-Rex: That's ridiculous!
Text: No. That's MURDER.
