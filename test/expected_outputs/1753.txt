Narrator: T-REX'S BEST NIGHT EVER T-REX'S PLACE 9:00 PM
God: DUDE IT IS MOST DEFINITELY TIME FOR SOME HIJINKS

Narrator: T-REX'S PLACE 11 AM THE NEXT DAY
T-Rex: Best night EVER!!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you know those 80s movies where a group of teens have one FINAL CRAZY NIGHT before they all graduate and go their separate ways? Last night was like that! Only instead of being a group of teens who learn about life AND each other, I was AN OLDER NON-TEEN who has obligations AND responsibilities!
T-Rex: ...Wait.
T-Rex: I'm making this sound not as rad as it should be.

Utahraptor: Your mistake was comparing yourself to teens, my friend!
T-Rex: Man! Nobody can compete with teens!

T-Rex: I could be telling you a story about a friggin' SPACE ASTRONAUT and you'd be all "Neato", but if someone else starting talking about Teen Astro: Astronaut Teenager, there's no way you wouldn't listen.
Utahraptor: Teen Astro sounds kinda dumb, actually.
T-Rex: Please!

T-Rex: He's been to Pluto and back... and he's still 100% teen!!
T-Rex: He's the most compelling character of our generation; we all know it
