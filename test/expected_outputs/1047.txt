T-Rex: I think it is time YET AGAIN to have a manliness competition!

Panel 2:
T-Rex: For reals this time!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: I'm so manly that whenever I sneeze I accidentally rip open my shirt, because all my muscles flex at once! Sometimes I rip open my SKIN.
Dromiceiomimus: That's gross and you should wear bigger shirts. I'm so manly that when I glance at pregnant women they become pregnant with MY child instead. My line of sight is SO MANLY that it impregnates already pregnant women. Just in case that wasn't clear.

Panel 4:
Utahraptor: Man, Chuck Norris did it already!
T-Rex: Who?

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: Chuck Norris! You can't tell me that you've been oblivious to the whole "Chuck never cries because he's THAT MANLY" thing. I KNOW you were on the internet 6 months ago.
T-Rex: But I've been having manliness competitions for years! I'm so manly that I punched a car up a hill and then it went all the way up the hill!!

Panel 6:
T-Rex: ▹It Was On The Local News.◃
