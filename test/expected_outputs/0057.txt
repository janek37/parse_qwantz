T-Rex: I wonder what's bothering the Utahraptor? ◖He totally "wigged out" on me yesterday.◗

T-Rex: 〚thinks〛 What a great expression!

T-Rex: Did you hear? The Utahraptor totally "wigged out" on me yesterday!
Dromiceiomimus: He "wigged out"?
T-Rex: He totally did!
T-Rex: Yesterday!

T-Rex: Yesterday, he "wigged out"!
Utahraptor: Stop it, T-Rex!

T-Rex: How long have you been standing there?
Utahraptor: Long enough! Look, about yesterday: I'm sorry I said what I did. I've just been a little stressed lately. Also, stop saying "wigged out". I know you like it, but it really annoys me.

T-Rex: Don't make me choose!!
