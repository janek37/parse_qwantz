Panel 1:
Narrator: HILARIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES
Narrator: presented using a primarily-male cast of dinosaurs
T-Rex: Oh boy!

Panel 2:
T-Rex: I bet I can figure out hundreds of hilarious differences!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: For instance: as a male, I can be impatient, sometimes to my own detriment! Notice how I destroy this house rather than walking around it.
Dromiceiomimus: I am a more patient woman and I did not resort to violence to solve my problems!
T-Rex: It is as if we are from two different planets!

Panel 4:
T-Rex: Yes, the two sexes certainly do have some hilarious differences!
Utahraptor: Indeed!

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: For instance, my mother was left, at the age of 22 and with two children to care for, by a sometimes-abusive, always-absent husband.
Utahraptor: I know this may be sexist, but I don't believe a woman is capable of such neglect.

Panel 6:
Narrator: LATER...
T-Rex: Hey!
T-Rex: I can also pee standing up!
