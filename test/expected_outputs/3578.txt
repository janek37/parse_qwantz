Panel 1:
Text: Dear diary. T-Rex here. Today, while I was walking, I found a quarter on the ground!

Panel 2:
Text: I know, right?

Panel 3:
Text: Then I ran into a friend, and she told me SHE'D found a quarter on the ground too. That was weird, but not super weird. Just a little weird, you know?
Text: Then I found another quarter on the ground a bit later.
Text: And another.

Panel 4:
Text: And then another friend ran up and told me about all the quarters HE had found. Something was going on.

Panel 5:
Text: There were quarters everywhere, all around us. Everyone else was ignoring them, stepping on them, but we could see them. At first we thought "hidden camera show?" but no - it went on for too long. That was 28 hours ago. The quarters are everywhere now. People are trudging ankle-deep through discarded change and acting like there's nothing wrong.

Panel 6:
Text: I don't know what's happening or why but by the end of this I'm gonna be riiiiich
