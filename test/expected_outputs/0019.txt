T-Rex: Man, I totally blew it yesterday with the Utahraptor. Why did I make a joke about his mom?

T-Rex: Why oh why did I make a joke about his mom?

T-Rex: Hey, I need some more advice. How can I apologise to the Utahraptor for saying that I had sex with his mom last night?
Dromiceiomimus: You didn't.
T-Rex: Yeah... I kinda shouted it after him.
T-Rex: Three times.
Dromiceiomimus: Man. Well, here's what you have to do...

Narrator: LATER...
Utahraptor: Don't you take a day off? Quit stomping on things!
T-Rex: 〚tiny〛 now's my chance!

T-Rex: Uh - well, what I want to say is that I'm sorry I said I had sex with your Mom last night. I actually didn't have sex with anyone last night.
T-Rex: Or ever, for that matter.
Utahraptor: WHAT?
Utahraptor: What about us?!

T-Rex: I can't help it if I can't remember it!
Off panel: And I can't help it if you are a stupid dinosaur! I wish I never met you!
T-Rex: oh, give me a BREAK!
