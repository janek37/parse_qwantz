T-Rex: We sleep at night because we're tired!

T-Rex: And we're tired because we were up all day!!

God: T-REX IS THERE A POINT TO THIS OR ARE YOU
God: YOU KNOW
God: JUST FIGURING THIS OUT NOW
T-Rex: My point is, there's no real reason why we sleep at night EXCEPT that we were up during the day! We could sleep all day and party all night if only we had the audacity, the sheer force of will!

Utahraptor: Some people do this, T-Rex! There's advantages to it.
T-Rex: Do tell!

Utahraptor: Well let's see: less traffic, a shorter line for the slide at the park, I can't think of any others but there's probably more...
T-Rex: DUDE, I'm doing this. I'm staying up all night and sometimes even into the early afternoon for some crazy 2pm parties!!

Narrator: BUT IT HAS A SIDE EFFECT:
T-Rex: When I look up at lunch instead of a single sun I see millions, their ancient starlight dancing in my eyes because unlike most, mine were open. How can I ever go back, trading the beauty of the universe for one lonely sun?
Off panel: Dude I think you took too much
