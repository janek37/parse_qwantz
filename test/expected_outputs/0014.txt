Panel 1:
T-Rex: Forget it! All these personal revelations have left me baffled, disoriented. Values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated!
T-Rex: I believe this is called "nihilism".
Panel 2:
T-Rex: When we abandon illusions, life is revealed as nothing! It is nothing short of absurd!
Panel 3:
T-Rex: There is no objective order to the world: all values are baseless and reasoning is impotent!
T-Rex: Destruction is the natural response to such a metaphysical collapse!
T-Rex: GoodBYE, house!
Panel 4:
T-Rex: It is futile to do one's best in an absurd world!
Utahraptor: Wait!
Panel 5:
Utahraptor: Is it not true that a "cheerful nihilism" can carry the day, distinguished by an easy-going acceptance of meaninglessness? There is no need for such physical and psychological destruction.
Utahraptor: Consider that!
Panel 6:
T-Rex: If we accept that all perspectives are equally non-binding, then intellectual or moral arrogance will determine which perspective has precedence!
T-Rex: MY APOCALYPTIC TENOR HAS NOT BEEN DISPELLED!
