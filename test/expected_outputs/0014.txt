T-Rex: Forget it! All these personal revelations have left me baffled, disoriented. Values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated!
T-Rex: I believe this is called "nihilism".

T-Rex: When we abandon illusions, life is revealed as nothing! It is nothing short of absurd!

T-Rex: There is no objective order to the world: all values are baseless and reasoning is impotent!

T-Rex: MY APOCALYPTIC TENOR HAS NOT BEEN DISPELLED!
