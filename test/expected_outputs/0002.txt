Panel 1:
T-Rex: With that Utahraptor out of the way I feel better! A rare pleasure indeed, to have your problems put behind you and the future full of promise!
Panel 2:
T-Rex: Imagine if that Utahraptor slipped in the shower?
Panel 3:
T-Rex: He'd certainly wish he'd stomped the soap out of the way (much as I now stomp this little house) as he passed on!
T-Rex: Perhaps in his last moments, the irony of the situation - from my perspective - would become evident.
Panel 4:
T-Rex: Yes, I will freely enjoy stomping more now that he is gone!
Utahraptor: Stop!
Panel 5:
T-Rex: You?
Utahraptor: You have retreated too far into the realm of fantasy and have forgotten that I did not in fact expire in the shower!
Panel 6:
T-Rex: I must guard against such self-absorption in the future!
T-Rex: I GUESS THERE IS A LESSON HERE FOR US ALL!
