T-Rex: So as I was saying, for all intensive purposes, the REAL bro here is -
God: I THINK YOU MEAN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
T-Rex: Hello? Purposes just got intense!!

God: IT'S STILL THE WRONG WORD
T-Rex: Far be it for me to correct GOD, but -

God: FAR BE IT FROM ME
T-Rex: Right. But it's kinda a mute point -
God: MOOT POINT
T-Rex: ...Okay. I get that as God you're a font of knowledge, but -
God: FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE
T-Rex: Um, both are off-quoted sayings of the same origin -
God: OFT-QUOTED YOU MEAN

T-Rex: FINE. I'll try another tact!
God: TACK
Utahraptor: Arguing with God again, T-Rex?

T-Rex: YES. Apparently I only know a hack-kneed pigeon English, and today God's decided to ignore ALL SOCIAL MORAYS and correct me NON-STOP.
Utahraptor: Well, you ARE using the wrong words. I counted three.
T-Rex: Oh, I guess I'd better be internally grateful then!! THANKS GOD! THANKS UTAHRAPTOR!

Narrator: LATER: T-REX LEARNS THE CORRECT SAYING IS "DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD"
T-Rex: I thought it was a doggy-dog world!! Dog-eat-dog is WAY more graphic. I'd - I'd really prefer to live in a doggy-dog world.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: Well, all be darned.
