T-Rex: Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. And I’d like to take a minute - just sit right there -

T-Rex: I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air!

T-Rex: In West Philadelphia, born and raised: on the playground was where I spent most of my days! Chilling out, maxin', relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys (they were up to no good) started making trouble in my neighbourhood! I got in ONE LITTLE FIGHT and my mom got scared, and said
Dromiceiomimus: You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel-Air!

T-Rex: I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror!
Utahraptor: T-Rex?
T-Rex: 〚tiny〛 ssh!

T-Rex: If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it: yo home, to Bel-Air!"
Utahraptor: You
Utahraptor: pulled
Utahraptor: up to a house about seven or eight and you yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes, smell you later!"?

T-Rex: Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Awesome! Okay, what was it you wanted to talk about?
