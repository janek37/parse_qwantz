T-Rex: I feel that I know what's best for me, and I have no right to judge your beliefs!
T-Rex: All beliefs and ethics are "relative"!

Narrator: UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL RELATIVISM

T-Rex: I stomp this house because I feel it would be a good idea to do so! Do not judge me, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: But I believe it is wrong! Which of us is right?
T-Rex: That is the beauty of relativism: we both are!

T-Rex: Ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever!
Utahraptor: Oh really?!

Utahraptor: 〚mini〛 It can be argued that in every rational person (the definition of ‘rational’ is a touchy subject I won't discuss here) there are certain properties common to all. The problem (well, one problem) with relativism is how it nihilistically privileges the experience of the individual above all else, making every ethical decision the right ethical decision: who would not like to have his or her beliefs guaranteed to be as correct as anybody else’s? But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities, turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures (and continents and skin colours) we all believe some of the same things. With that striking and fundamental truth removed, the baby-rapers and the saints stand side by side, equals in righteousness.

T-Rex: 〚small〛 But your first assumption is flawed! I doubt you can find even one universal constant; even your revealing example of baby-rape is practised by some! Granted, these people are considered "monsters", but isn't that just a case of the majority condeming a minority? I don't mean to justify baby-rape, only to point out that it's unlikely you can come up with even one belief that is universal!
