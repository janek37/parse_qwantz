T-Rex: I hope I don't run into the Dromiceiomimus today! She probably thinks I'm crazy since I asked for a "thigh five" the last time we met.

T-Rex: Oh shoot, there she is! Time to go INCOGNITO!

Dromiceiomimus: Hey T-Rex, what's up? Out for a walk, I see?
T-Rex: T-Rex? Who es T-Rex? I am a different, um, Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah, really? You're not the T-Rex who demands thigh fives from his friends?
T-Rex: Darn it!

T-Rex: She remembers! I'll never live this down!
Utahraptor: What are you so concerned about?

Utahraptor: It was just a wacky slip of the tongue! It's funny - this one time in high school, a friend of mine meant to type "I raised my HAND to block the sun" but instead wrote "hind", and since he wasn't the slimmest guy... oh man!
Utahraptor: Good times, good times!

God: OH MAN I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE
T-Rex: People laugh at typos in heaven?!
God: SOMETIMES WE DO
