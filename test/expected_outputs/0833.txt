Panel 1:
T-Rex: Time for me to learn some new languages! AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, he who can speak many languages is suspected by his peers to be an ultra super genius times two.

Panel 2:
T-Rex: Perhaps I will learn... SIGN LANGUAGE?

Panel 3:
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, you should, T-Rex! Then we could talk to each other!
T-Rex: You know sign language?
Dromiceiomimus: Yep! Well - I know Signed English, which is just English translated into hand signs. It's different from ASL, which is a true natural signed language with its own grammar!
T-Rex: Neat!

Panel 4:
T-Rex: Then it's settled! I will learn sign language!
Utahraptor: And I will learn Zulu!

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: I've always wanted to learn a language nobody around me speaks, and I like the way Zulu sounds.
T-Rex: Dude, maybe we're TRENDSETTERS! Maybe in 3 months languages less spoken will be the very CURRENCY of coolness, a shibboleth for entry into the rarefied world of ULTRA POPULARITY!

Panel 6:
Off panel: That only works if we're ultra popular, but we're just two dudes who have decided in the past 60 seconds to learn some new languages for no real reason!
T-Rex: My question: WHAT COULD BE COOLER THAN THAT??
