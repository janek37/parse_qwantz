Panel 1:
Narrator: INFORMED OPINIONS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY COMICS
T-Rex: Yes! I have actually done some research this time. Schwing!

Panel 2:
T-Rex: And it turns out I was TOTALLY CORRECT!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: Archaeologists ARE aware that they're mining a finite resource, and when possible, they only dig a little and leave some for the future. But there are time limits: often they'll be examining a site just before it's dug up for a new building or something, which means this is their last chance to see what's there before it's destroyed. And sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don't dig soon, whatever's there will be lost anyway!

Panel 4:
T-Rex: In conclusion and in summary, way to go archaeologists!
Utahraptor: Hooray for archaeologists!

Panel 5:
T-Rex and Utahraptor: We have nothing but good things to say about the women and men of archaeology! Nothing but smiles for the trained and capable few who dedicate themselves towards exploring and explaining our shared history!

Panel 6:
Narrator: LATER: ARCHAEOLOGISTS TOTAL T-REX'S CAR!
T-Rex: Damn it, archaeologists!
