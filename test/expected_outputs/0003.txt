Panel 1:
T-Rex: I feel today that my actions will be charged with symbolism.

Panel 2:
T-Rex: *gasp*

Panel 3:
T-Rex: As a male, I take on the position of the Everyman - with the latter syllable perhaps the most important from our post-feminist perspective. The house clearly represents repressed feminity, at once recalling the blissful days of the past, while reminding us of their fundamental injustices.
T-Rex: {small} My action in destroying the house remains a puzzling enigma.

Panel 4:
T-Rex: The emphasis on male oppression is continued as I stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man-foot.
Utahraptor: No!

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: I've always seen you more as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half.
T-Rex: Oh, that is a part of it, to be sure.

Panel 6:
T-Rex: ...but the desires of my darker nature manifest themselves as misogyny!
T-Rex: Surely that must enter into your analysis!
