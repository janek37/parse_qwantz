T-Rex: As a male, I take on the position of the Everyman - with the latter syllable perhaps the most important from our post-feminist perspective. The house clearly represents repressed feminity, at once recalling the blissful days of the past, while reminding us of their fundamental injustices.

T-Rex: The emphasis on male oppression is continued as I stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man-foot.
Utahraptor: No!

Utahraptor: I've always seen you more as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half.

T-Rex: Surely that must enter into your analysis!
