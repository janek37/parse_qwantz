Panel 1:
Narrator: I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Dear recipient of this comic:

Panel 2:
T-Rex: It isn't working out!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: Maybe it's not you, it's me! MAYBE there were many small things that added up to this relationship not working.
T-Rex: I don't know. This card isn't very personalized.
T-Rex: Come to think of it, I'd be pretty pissed if someone broke up with me like this!

Panel 4:
Utahraptor: Yeah, this is even worse than a break-up email! You have to at least compose an email.
T-Rex: Too true!

Panel 5:
T-Rex: I think whoever is being dumped here is better off without this person!
Utahraptor: Me too!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: Dear recipient of this comic: You're better off without this jerk!

Panel 6:
T-Rex: I would still like to hear about the sex, however!
