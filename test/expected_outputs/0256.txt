Panel 1:
T-Rex: You know how sometimes you wonder what your life would be like, if only you made some decisions differently?

Panel 2:
T-Rex: Well, I intend to find out!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: It'll be great! I'll move to a new town and START OVER. Then every chance I have, I'll make the other decision: the one I didn't make the first time!
T-Rex: It'll be great! And if things turn out worse with these new decisions, well then - lesson learned! I'll just move back here and never speak of it again.

Panel 4:
T-Rex: Then it's settled: I'll move to a new town, make new friends, and start a whole new identity!
Utahraptor: Why?

Panel 5:
T-Rex: "Why"?
Utahraptor: Yeah, "why", as in, "Why move away and start life again?" What, did you commit some horrible crime?
T-Rex: Ha ha!
T-Rex: **NO**, I didn't commit some horrible crime!

Panel 6:
T-Rex: (thinks) _Right?_
