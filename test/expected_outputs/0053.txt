Panel 1:
T-Rex: I have a friend, of my own age, who is having a relationship - the only word for it is "affair" - with a woman who is engaged to be married!
T-Rex: It's time for...

Panel 2:
Narrator: ADULTEROUS AFFAIRS COMICS

Panel 3:
T-Rex: It kind of came out of nowhere... she is into him and he is into her, so where's the problem? What's the big deal about polygamy?
T-Rex: The problem of course is the fianc√©, who (as I understand it) does not support his wife-to-be sleeping around with another man.
T-Rex: Further complications: both men look the same! It's a little weird.

Panel 4:
T-Rex: How am I to advise this friend - should he break it off? Should he let the woman make her own decisions?
Utahraptor: Hmm!

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: I didn't realize such situations occured in real life... a young woman, engaged to be married to an older man, meets a dynamic young one and falls in love!
T-Rex: Yes, it's a hackneyed situation, but one which all involved are living, as we speak!

Panel 6:
T-Rex: Hey, wait!
T-Rex: Come back!
T-Rex: YOU FORGOT TO GIVE ME THE ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM!
