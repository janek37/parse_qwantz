T-Rex: Guess what I got last night?

T-Rex: A ◖dog◗!

T-Rex: Did you know that dogs and dinosaurs co-existed?
Dromiceiomimus: Yes, I accepted it without questioning.
T-Rex: Good!

T-Rex: I am excited to go play with my new pet dog!
Utahraptor: What are you going to name him?

T-Rex: I am thinking, "T-Junior".
Utahraptor: That's terrible.
T-Rex: What about "Dogasaurus Rex"?
Utahraptor: Excuse me.

T-Rex: Well, it's better than "Utahraptor"!
T-Rex: What is that anyway, a place?
T-Rex: "Utah"?
