Panel 1:
T-Rex: Sometimes, people get BIG into pi! Like BIG into it. Like maybe a little too big into it??

Panel 2:
T-Rex: And they start to make works of art inspired by it!

Panel 3:
Dromiceiomimus: What sort of art can you make out of an infinite series of random numbers?
T-Rex: Technically: all art, if you're willing to wait long enough! But this is more like "What if I wrote a book where the length of each word was determined by the corresponding digit of pi?"
Dromiceiomimus: Huh - sounds like a chore to me.

Panel 4:
Utahraptor: Yeah, it sounds like a real trial both to write AND read!

Panel 5:
T-Rex: Listen: you're not wrong. But I just think it's interesting that inspiration is everywhere! And honestly, if I want to be inspired by the digits in "3.14159", who's going to stop me?
Utahraptor: I will. I will stop you right now, T-Rex.

Panel 6:
T-Rex: No you won't.
Off panel: Yes I will.
T-Rex: No.
Off panel: Yes.
T-Rex: NO.
Off panel: YES.
T-Rex: NO, AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY HELPING ME RIGHT NOW!
Off panel: AW DANG IT
Off panel: I HATE BEING FOILED
