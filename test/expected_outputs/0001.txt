T-Rex: Today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things! As a dinosaur, stomping is the best part of my day indeed!

T-Rex: *gasp*

T-Rex: What's that, little house? You wish you were back in your own time? THAT IS TOO BAD FOR YOU

T-Rex: Perhaps you too will get a stomping, little girl!
Utahraptor: WAIT!

Utahraptor: Is stomping really the answer to your problem(s)?
T-Rex: Problem(s)?

T-Rex: My only problem(s) have to do with you interrupting my stomping!
T-Rex: 〚small〛 crazy utahraptor!
