T-Rex: I think I have a problem, guys.

T-Rex: I think I have some feelings!

T-Rex: Yep, I definitely think I got some feelings on me. And as a man who inures himself to all but the most entertaining of emotions, I am neither inclined nor equipped to deal with these feelings!
Dromiceiomimus: What feelings?
T-Rex: I don't want to talk about them, Dromiceiomimus! On account of how they're SUPER BORING??

Utahraptor: Haha, you've got a case of the feelings!
T-Rex: I know!

T-Rex: But I'm looking for help, not for teasing.
Utahraptor: Well, without knowing what the feelings are, um - I suppose you could figure out their root cause, and then deal with that issue?
T-Rex: FINE, but if this doesn't solve the feelings, I'm gonna be SO CHEEZED!!

T-Rex: ...Wait. Feeling cheezed is a feeling! And that new feeling will automatically drown out any leftover original feelings!
T-Rex: T-REX WINS AGAIN
