Panel 1:
Narrator: LECTURE NOTES COMICS
Narrator: TODAY'S LECTURE: DISCRETE MATH
T-Rex: Pay attention, now!
Narrator: if you do not like math then skip this comic
Narrator: (seriously)

Panel 2:
T-Rex: {small} The circuit satisfiability problem is determining if there are some inputs that make the output of a circuit "true"!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: {small} A closely related problem is the formula satisfiability problem, SAP, which can be mapped one-to-one, and in linear time, to the circuit satisfiability problem.

Panel 4:
Utahraptor: {small} So what does this mean?
T-Rex: {small} If we can solve SAT problems in f(n) time, then circuit-SAT can be solved in O(n) + f(n) time!

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: {small} But circuit-SAT can not be solved quickly.
T-Rex: {small} Indeed. Therefore, SAT is as "hard" as circuit-SAT.
T-Rex: {small} Similarly hard problems are "Clique", "Vertex-Cover" and the Travelling Salesman Problem.

Panel 6:
T-Rex: {small} Solving these problems (P) can be accomplished in polynomial time!
T-Rex: {small} Verifying solutions (NP) can also be done in polynomial time!
T-Rex: {small} The question is...
T-Rex: {small} does P = NP?
