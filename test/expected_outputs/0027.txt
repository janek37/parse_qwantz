Narrator: A CAUTIONARY TALE
Narrator: TOLD VIA DINOSAUR PROXY

Narrator: PART ONE

T-Rex: I see all of my relations in economic terms! You provide value to me by providing me a "sounding board" for my ideas, and also (potentially) as a mate!
T-Rex: Conversely, this house provides no value to me, and my relation with it is understandably strained!
Dromiceiomimus: 〚small〛 please leave me be

T-Rex: You too provide no value to me, young woman! That is why I stomp you with impunity.
Utahraptor: Hold it!

Utahraptor: Does not seeing everything through the lens of economics ultimately reduce all relationships, in fact all of life, to mere line items on a hypothetical statement of earnings?

T-Rex: Shit!
