T-Rex: Man... after what happened yesterday, I guess there is a certain tension between myself and the Utahraptor. Well, I'm going to make sure that tension ends...

T-Rex: ... right now!

T-Rex: Hey, do you know how I could stop the Utahraptor from not being friends with me?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe if you stopped stomping on things - that seems to annoy him more than anything else.
T-Rex: Forget it! Stomping is who I am!
Sound effect: STOMP!

T-Rex: I will have to find another way to win his friendship!
Utahraptor: You're talking about me again?

Utahraptor: Look, I appreciate the sentiment, but you've got to stop trying so hard. It's just got to happen, naturally, over time.
Utahraptor: Relationships take time and effort. They can't happen overnight.

T-Rex: HEY!
T-Rex: That's not what your Mom said!
T-Rex: Last night!
T-Rex: When we had SEX!
