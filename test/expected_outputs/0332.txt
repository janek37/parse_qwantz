Panel 1:
T-Rex: I had some companions over to my new house last night and gave them a tour! It was a smashing success, except for one thing:

Panel 2:
T-Rex: Some of them thought that my rooms "lacked identity"!

Panel 3:
T-Rex: When I (politely) pressed them to explain, they said that while the rooms were decorated nicely, they were decorated generically and had little to offer that was unique to me.
Dromiceiomimus: How did this make you feel?
T-Rex: A little miffed, a little peeved: a little upset!

Panel 4:
Utahraptor: Well, what do your rooms look like?
T-Rex: You haven't seen them?

Panel 5:
Utahraptor: No: you haven't invited me over since you got your new place.
T-Rex: Well, do you want to come over now?
Utahraptor: To see generic rooms? No thanks!

Panel 6:
Narrator: BACK AT HOME...
T-Rex: I _like_ the white!
