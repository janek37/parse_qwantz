T-Rex: I know some opinions aren't "popular", but that doesn't scare me, and I'm gonna say what I REALLY think:

T-Rex: I think all diseases should be cured!

T-Rex: I really think we should get ON THAT already!!

Utahraptor: Maybe you should try to cure them yourself?
T-Rex: Man, I'm not good at that junk!

T-Rex: But you know what I am good at? Motivation. In my house RIGHT NOW sits a $5 bill that I will mail to the FIRST PERSON who cures all diseases, no questions asked!
Utahraptor: Well, maybe "whoah, frig dude, how did you cure all diseases?".
T-Rex: Okay, one question asked.

Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: "Can the process be generalized to any new diseases?"
T-Rex: 18 questions asked.
Off panel: "What monster would hold off on curing all diseases until they were paid $5?"
T-Rex: Hmm! That's pretty similar to question 7, actually
