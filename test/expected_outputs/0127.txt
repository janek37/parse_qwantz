T-Rex: I am tired of things not getting done my way.

T-Rex: Therefore, I am going into politics!

T-Rex: As a politician, I will have power and influence! Things will get done, and they will get done my way! Finally, I will be the person making all the important decisions!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, we live in a democracy of dinosaurs! You'll have to get elected if you wish to have power!
T-Rex: I see!

T-Rex: Will you vote for me?
Utahraptor: Well, um, what's your platform? What issues are you concerned about?
Utahraptor: My mom works at the library, and there have been cutbacks lately, so that's a concern for us.

T-Rex: Your mom's a librarian?!
T-Rex: That's AWESOME!
