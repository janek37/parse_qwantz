Devil: T-REX I WAS RECENTLY SPECULATING ON THE PROMISE OF AR AND WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD REMARK ON THIS MATTER
T-Rex: I don't even know what Ayar is! Please don't tell me.
Devil: IT IS AN ACRONYM FOR AUGMENTED REALITY

T-Rex: Aw man, now I know one more nerd thing!! SO MUCH FOR KISSING SUPERMODELS.

Devil: I BELIEVE THERE EXIST SUPERMODELS WHO KISS THOSE WHO KNOW THINGS ABOUT AUGMENTED REALITY IN FACT MOST OF THE PROMINENT AR RESEARCHERS ARE MARRIED TO MODELS OF THE SUPER PERSUASION
T-Rex: FINE. Tell me about AR.
Devil: RATHER THAN REPLACING THE WORLD YOU MERELY DIGITALLY ENHANCE IT SO YOU HAVE A SHOOTER USING REAL-WORLD ARCHITECTURE AND ONLY THE ENEMIES WOULD BE VIRTUAL

T-Rex: OR while hiking, a giant arrow in the sky could mark your destination! That'd be awesome!
Utahraptor: What's this?

T-Rex: Augmented reality! I guess you'd sport semi-transparent glasses and a wearable computer, but it could detect your location and display all sorts of cool things for you to see! The Devil told me about it?
Utahraptor: Yep, it's sentences like that that make me think you maybe SHOULDN'T tell folks where your ideas come from.

T-Rex: Can we play AR games RIGHT NOW, The Devil?
Devil: UNFORTUNATELY CONSUMER-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY IS YEARS AWAY BUT AS A TIMELESS INCARNATION OF EVIL I WILL STILL BE AROUND TO PLAY IT UPON RELEASE
Devil: ROCK
