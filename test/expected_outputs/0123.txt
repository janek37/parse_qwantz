T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for sharing secrets!

Narrator: SECRET SHARING COMICS

T-Rex: Hey Dromiceiomimus, want to know a secret?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!
T-Rex: Alright, but you have to promise not to tell anyone!
Dromiceiomimus: Ok!
T-Rex: Ok, my secret is that I stole the Utahraptor's couch last night! Don't tell him, alright?

Utahraptor: T-Rex, have you seen my couch? It's gone missing!
T-Rex: Oh?

Utahraptor: Yes, and there were ◖T-Rex◗ prints all over my shag carpet.
T-Rex: Well, ah, heh-
T-Rex: You see, the thing is...
T-Rex: um

T-Rex: Can I let you in on a secret?
