Narrator: FATALISM COMICS

T-Rex: Fatalism is when - ah, screw it!

T-Rex: I'm sure if you were meant to know about fatalism, you'd find out about it eventually. In any case, fatalism is the belief that future events are predetermined for the whole of time and are entirely unalterable!

Utahraptor: You just defined fatalism... ▹despite your best efforts not to!◃
T-Rex: Oh my God!

T-Rex: It was FATE! I was destined to define fatalism as the belief that future events are predetermined for the whole of time, and are entirely unalterable!
Utahraptor: You just did it again!!
T-Rex: OH MY GOSH! Is this my role in life? Am I to be forever DEFINING FATALISM?

God: PROBABLY NOT
T-Rex: Looks like nope!
