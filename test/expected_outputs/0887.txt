Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENRE II
T-Rex: I'm going nuts!

T-Rex: LIQUID NUTS!

T-Rex: See what I did there, Dromiceiomimus? I used "liquid" as an intensifier.
Dromiceiomimus: Like "super"?
T-Rex: Yep! It goes nuts, super nuts, nutty crackers, and then liquid nuts for only the nuttiest things.
Dromiceiomimus: Can this also be applied to chocolate bars?
T-Rex: YOU KNOW IT CAN'T. That would be heresy!

Utahraptor: Liquid heresy!
T-Rex: Exactly!

Utahraptor: I do think "nuts" can be applied to chocolate bars though.
T-Rex: Okay honestly it can apply to chocolate bars, but it becomes confusing if the bar isn't crammed with nuts, or somehow liquidly nutty. There is a SEMANTIC COLLISION.

Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: Anyway, I meant what I said about going nuts. I feel like I've got this powerful instinct for self-destruction, and I'm just fooling myself if I think I can control it.
Off panel: You're so crazy, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I'm wacky times!
