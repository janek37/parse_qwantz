T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for taking control of my life! No longer will I allow myself to be pushed around (by random chance or otherwise)!

T-Rex: My old push-over self is extinct - now I'm a self-motivated dynamo!

T-Rex: Stupid log cabin in my way! Prepare to be returned to the ground! Entropy is always increasing!
Dromiceiomimus: You justify your destruction via science?
T-Rex: You shut up! Don't try to push me around!

T-Rex: You too are in my way, little woman!
Utahraptor: No she's not! You're in her way!

T-Rex: What did you say?
Utahraptor: I said maybe you should stop being such a jerk!

T-Rex: Maybe you should stop being such a jerk also!
T-Rex: Maybe THAT!
