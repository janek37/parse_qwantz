T-Rex: Okay! Good to know!

Devil: SO CAN YOU BUY A CONSOLE AND THEN I CAN COME OVER
T-Rex: Aw, come on. No!
Utahraptor: No what?

Devil: I CAN ASSURE YOU OF GOOD TIMES AND FURTHER OF MY PROCURING OF BRAND-NAME POTATO CHIPS
T-Rex: One sec, Utahraptor. FINE. If I ever get a new video game console you can come over and play video games on it. ONCE.
Utahraptor: Sweet!
Devil: SWEET

Narrator: LATER:
Devil: T-REX THIS INTELLIVISION IS OLDER THAN MY GRANDMOTHER
