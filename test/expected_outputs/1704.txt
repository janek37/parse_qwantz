Off-Panel: _WE MISSED YOUR SCENT_

Panel 3:
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Well, I'm not sure what I was expecting. Oh wait, yes I do! I WAS EXPECTING TO LEAVE MY INCREDIBLY CREEPY RACCOONO-CEPHALOPOD NEIGHBOURS BEHIND. They followed me, Dromiceiomimus! THEY moved to the place next to MY new place!
Dromiceiomimus: Aww! That's adorable!

Panel 4:
T-Rex: IT'S NOT ADORABLE.
Utahraptor: It's kinda adorable!

Panel 5:
T-Rex: You know what's adorable? PUPPIES. Not nimble-handed scavengers who EAT LIFE, not multi-armed sea-dwelling cannibals bringing their intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic, wholly and singularly to bear on the problem of CREEPING ME THE HECK OUT.
Utahraptor: I like 'em.

Panel 6:
Narrator: LATER:
Off-Panel: _WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, T-REX! WE BROUGHT YOU SOME PUDDING_

Off-Panel: _- WELL, YOU'LL SEE_
