Narrator: TWO WEEKS LATER...
T-Rex: After all the crazy adventures in sexy exciting locales we've had over the past two weeks, it seems that the Utahraptor and I are friends again!

T-Rex: It's been a memorable two weeks indeed!

T-Rex: Do you recall a few days ago, when we had that hilarious conversation?
Dromiceiomimus: I thought I would die laughing!
T-Rex: It was good times!

T-Rex: So many memories, of the past two weeks...
Utahraptor: Hey, good buddy!

T-Rex: How are you?
Utahraptor: Great! AND, I finally thought of the perfect answer to the question you asked me, two weeks ago!
T-Rex: Oh?
Utahraptor: "No"!

T-Rex: 〚thinks〛 Genius!
