T-Rex: Shakespeare was a famous writer guy, but we know basically nothing about him! There's only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day.

T-Rex: And at other times, there's no record of him for years and years!

T-Rex: The fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness, and that he got married. Legal records are all we've got! His interests and tastes, politics and loves - they all have to be (unreliably) extrapolated from his writing.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, he IS from the past, and 80% of the plays from his time survive as titles alone! We're lucky to have the data we do.

T-Rex: That's true! I just wish we knew more about the man, you know?
Utahraptor: You're not alone in that!

T-Rex: So let's agree! If one of us ever get a chance to go back in time, and we run into him, then we'll definitely ask Shakespeare what he was up to. What he likes, what his interests are - all the stuff historians wish they had!
Utahraptor: Hah! Okay, it's a deal!

Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!
T-Rex: SHAKESPEARE! OH SHAKESPEARE! DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY CAR KEYS ARE, SHAKESSPEARE
Off panel: alack me! i'm trying to write some sonnets here, t-rex!
T-Rex: HEY SHAKESPEARE!
T-Rex: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ACTUALLY USED "ALACK" LIKE THAT
