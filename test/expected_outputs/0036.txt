T-Rex: Well, I hope wherever the Utahraptor ended up, he's alright. Maybe he landed in a Universe just like ours, but where one simple thing has undergone a sinister - and illustrative - change!

T-Rex: Or maybe he's travelled to the Universe of the Lesbians!

T-Rex: But I guess no matter where he is, this is the end of our daily conversations... I don't know what I'm going to do with the second half of my day if he's not around.

T-Rex: 〚small〛 *sigh*
Evil Utahraptor: T-Rex?

T-Rex: Utahraptor, it's you! You're back from the alternate Universe! But... something's different...
Evil Utahraptor: No! Nothing is different!
Evil Utahraptor: I am the same Utahraptor as always!

T-Rex: Prove it!
Off panel: I frequently debunk your theories!
T-Rex: *gasp*
