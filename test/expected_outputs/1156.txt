Narrator: T-REX VISITS A GHOST TOWN.
T-Rex: Attention, any ghosts that can hear me! I have one thing to say to you:

T-Rex: 〚small〛 this is awesome

Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: It was great, Dromiceiomimus: a whole town that had been abandoned! All these collapsing buildings and rusting machines. It was APOCALYPSE PORN.
Dromiceiomimus: I'd love to see it!
T-Rex: We should go! It's so great. You get a glimpse of what the world would be like if it all went wrong, and we all died tomorrow!

Utahraptor: What actually happened to the town?
T-Rex: The mine dried up and everyone moved away!

T-Rex: But the buildings are still there, and they're great. It's cliché, but walking around you see all these amazing little tokens of previous life: a forgotten doll, a can of food long since unidentifiable... Dromiceiomimus and I are going back. Want to come?
Utahraptor: Sure!

Narrator: BACK AT THE GHOST TOWN:
Off panel: It's okay, I guess. It's mostly just a bunch of crappy buildings!
T-Rex: Don't even, Utahraptor!
Off panel: Don't even what?
T-Rex: Don't even - don't even tell me you don't appreciate the stark aesthetics and beauty of decay
